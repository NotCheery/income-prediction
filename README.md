# Income Prediction

This project uses U.S. Census data to train and evaluate a machine learning model that predicts whether an individual's annual income exceeds $50,000.

## Tech Stack
* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Project Workflow
This project follows a standard data science workflow:
1.  **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handled missing values and encoded categorical features to prepare the data for modeling.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed the dataset to uncover patterns, correlations, and key insights between different demographic features and income levels.
3.  **Model Training:** Trained a Logistic Regression classification model on the preprocessed data.
4.  **Model Evaluation:** Assessed the model's performance using metrics like accuracy.
